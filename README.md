<h2>WebXR Misc Template Code Examples</h2>

Welcome to my A-frame WebXR simple code example templates for starting your own projects. These are A-frame VR examples of basic HTML and JavaScript.  Does not include associated assets and other code components, those can be accessed from the servers themselves, but you should ultimately copy them to your own webserver (https is necessary). When available I have include links to articles I have written explaining how the code works.  Many of the examples use networked-aframe https://github.com/networked-aframe/networked-aframe a multi-user WebRTC social VR component for servers.

Note: Please take special notice of the A-frame component version numbers used as there have been many changes and deprications and there are some later versions of A-frame and THREE.js that may break these code examples.  Some changes also have occured to the browsers, Chrome, Firefox, and the Meta Quest Browser.  As of May 26, 2022 these examples worked well on the Oculus Meta Quest 2.  No guarentees they will continue to work as the WebXR space is rapidly evolving.  Best always to search for other working examples on the web which may be more current and compare code.

IMPORTANT NOTICE: In some of the examples I may display wall art pieces, my photos and my paintings. <i>Be sure to replace my art with your own or art which you have rights to display, as my art is copyright and is here as a placeholder only for demonstration purposes.</i>  Also I have paid for license to a couple of songs (10,000 plays).  Please replace these with your own songs which you have rights for.  Everything else you should be able to copy and share (I have done my best to use only open source free available assets). Thank you for your honesty and consideration for the licensed work of others. Enjoy!
